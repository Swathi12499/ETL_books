        "description": "Includes new chapters with small, easy-to-understand words. Bestselling words! Fantasy football, fantasy baseball, fantasy basketball, even fantasy sumo wrestling: the world of fantasy sports is huge, and still growing. Today, more than 35 million people in the United States and Canada spend hours upon hours each week on their fantasy sports teams. And as the Senior Fantasy Sports Analyst for ESPN, Matthew Berry is on the front lines of what has grown from a niche subculture into a national pastime. In his New York Times-bestselling Fantasy Life, Berry celebrates every aspect of the fantasy sports world. Brilliant trash talk. Unbelievable trophies. Insane draft day locations. Shake-your-head-in-disbelief punishments. Ingenious attempts at cheating. And surprisingly uplifting stories that remind us why we play these games in the first place. Written with the same award-winning style that has made Berry one of the most popular columnists on ESPN.com, Fantasy Life is a book for both hard-core fantasy players and people who have never played before. Between tales of love and hate, birth and death, tattoos and furry animal costumes, the White House Situation Room and a 126-pound golden pelican, Matthew chronicles his journey from a fourteen-year-old fantasy player to the face of fantasy sports for the largest sports media company in the world. Fantasy will save your life. Fantasy will set you free. And fantasy life is most definitely better than real life. You\u2019ll see.",

        "description": "Legacy of Ash is an unmissable fantasy debut--an epic tale of intrigue and revolution, soldiers and assassins, ancient magic and the eternal clash of empires. A shadow has fallen over the Tressian Republic. Ruling families -- once protectors of justice and democracy -- now plot against one another with sharp words and sharper knives. Blinded by ambition, they remain heedless of the threat posed by the invading armies of the Hadari Empire. Yet as Tressia falls, heroes rise. Viktor Akadra is the Republic's champion. A warrior without equal, he hides a secret that would see him burned as a heretic. Josiri Trelan is Viktor's sworn enemy. A political prisoner, he dreams of reigniting his mother's failed rebellion. And yet Calenne Trelan, Josiri's sister, seeks only to break free of their tarnished legacy; to escape the expectation and prejudice that haunts the family name. As war spreads across the Republic, these three must set aside their differences in order to save their home. Yet decades of bad blood are not easily set aside. And victory -- if it comes at all -- will demand a darker price than any of them could have imagined.",

        "description": "Fiction. Drama. Literary Nonfiction. Film. Asian & Asian American Studies. Women's Studies. Part exegesis on Nobuhiko Obayashi's film HOUSE and part meditation on the ineffable specters that inhabit homes and ancestral histories, FANTASY is a daughter's story of her Vietnamese mother and their twin journeys towards belonging with one another and in the world. Where exilic, inherited memory encounters its limits, FANTASY reaches towards cult cinematic atmospheres, irreverent flowers, pop culture, and photographs with no images, making for a reading experience like no other. \"Schreiber uses the fabric of cinema and horror to quasi-measure the length and width of her pre-adolescent and adolescent consciousness. It's a GORGEOUS dress that the ghost in her psyche demands that it wears before falling into ash. Here, in these immolatable, scriptive dialogues with all of her consanguineous, anecdotal, exegetical selves ('who become shoes without feet that walk back and forth' in a house that eats like hungry ghosts), her psyche is cut, recut, uncut, though not forgotten, un-linearly and nonchalantly and numerously, by her relationship to film and her relationship with her Vietnamese mother, surrogated mother in grandmother(s) and auntie(s). ... As Kim-Anh Schreiber seeks closure with the uncloseable, we see an acutely talented scholar and inventive memoirist.\" --Vi Khi Nao. \"'Schreiber, the daughter of a Vietnamese refugee and a German immigrant, combines recognizable modes--memoir, criticism, dramatic play script--into something as uncategorizable as the film she deploys throughout the book as muse and foil: Nobuhiko Obayashi's 1977 post-Hiroshima 'horror-comedy' HOUSE, in which generations of women are trapped together in a haunted house. Beginning with extended considerations of the instability of memory ('an evocative curator'), of the 'impossible problem of drawing a picture,' and of the pull to use projection and doubling as bridges across gaps in experience and understanding, FANTASY finally resolves into a flickering, unstable but vivid portrait of a mother and daughter both separated and bonded by history, violence, human fallibility, and love.\" --Anna Moschovakis",

It\u2019s hard to look at her vast body of work--novels and stories across multiple genres, poems, translations, essays, speeches, and criticism--and see anything but one of our greatest writers, period. In a series of interviews with David Naimon (Between the Covers), Le Guin discusses craft, aesthetics, and philosophy in her fiction, poetry, and nonfiction respectively. The discussions provide ample advice and guidance for writers of every level, but also give Le Guin a chance to to sound off on some of her favorite subjects: the genre wars, the patriarchy, the natural world, and what, in her opinion, makes for great writing. With excerpts from her own books and those that she looked to for inspiration, this volume is a treat for Le Guin\u2019s longtime readers, a perfect introduction for those first approaching her writing, and a tribute to her incredible life and work.",

He may be just a bench warmer for his school's football team, but when it comes to knowing and loving the game, he's first-string. He even becomes a celebrity when his podcast gets noticed by a sports radio host, who plays Charlie's fantasy picks for all of Los Angeles to hear. Soon Charlie befriends the elderly owner of the L.A. Bulldogs -- a fictional NFL team -- and convinces him to take a chance on an aging quarterback. After that, watch out . . . it's press conferences and national fame as Charlie becomes a media curiosity and source of conflict for the Bulldogs general manager, whose job Charlie seems to have taken. It's all a bit much for a kid just trying to stay on top of his grades and maintain his friendship with his verbal sparring partner, Anna. Like the best Disney film in book form, like Moneyball for kids, Fantasy League is every football kid's dream scenario. \u201cLupica is the greatest sports writer for middle school readers.\u201d \u2013VOYA",

        "description": "Examining the complex relationships between the political, popular, sexual, and textual interests of Nathaniel Hawthorne's work, Lauren Berlant argues that Hawthorne mounted a sophisticated challenge to America's collective fantasy of national unity. She shows how Hawthorne's idea of citizenship emerged from an attempt to adjudicate among the official and the popular, the national and the local, the collective and the individual, utopia and history. At the core of Berlant's work is a three-part study of The Scarlet Letter, analyzing the modes and effects of national identity that characterize the narrator's representation of Puritan culture and his construction of the novel's political present tense. This analysis emerges from an introductory chapter on American citizenship in the 1850s and a following chapter on national fantasy, ranging from Hawthorne's early work \"Alice Doane's Appeal\" to the Statue of Liberty. In her conclusion, Berlant suggests that Hawthorne views everyday life and local political identities as alternate routes to the revitalization of the political and utopian promises of modern national life.",

Animation has played a key role in defining our collective expectations and experiences of fantasy cinema, just as fantasy storytelling has often served as inspiration for our most popular animated film and television. Bringing together contributions from world-renowned film and media scholars, Fantasy/Animation considers the various historical, theoretical, and cultural ramifications of the animated fantasy film. This collection provides a range of chapters on subjects including Disney, Pixar, and Studio Ghibli, filmmakers such as Ralph Bakshi and James Cameron, and on film and television franchises such as Dreamworks\u2019 How To Train Your Dragon (2010\u2013) and HBO\u2019s Game of Thrones (2011\u2013).",

        "description": "Fantasy literature, often derided as superficial and escapist, is one of the most popular and enduring genres of fiction worldwide. It is also\u2014perhaps surprisingly\u2014thought-provoking, structurally complex, and relevant to contemporary society, as the essays in this volume attest. The scholars, teachers, and authors represented here offer their perspectives on this engaging genre. Within these pages, a reader will find a wealth of ideas to help teachers use these texts in the classroom, challenging students to read fantasy with a critical eye. They employ interdisciplinary, philosophical, and religious lenses, as well as Marxist and feminist critical theory, to help students unlock texts. The books discussed include epic fantasy by such authors as Tolkien and Le Guin, children\u2019s fantasy by Beatrix Potter and Saint-Exup\u00e9ry, modern fantasy by Rowling and Martin, and even fairy tales and comic books. The contributors offer provocations, questioning the texts and pushing the boundaries of meaning within the fantasy genre. And in doing so, they challenge readers themselves to ponder these tales more deeply. But through each of these chapters runs a profound love of the genre and a respect for those who produce such beautiful and moving stories. Furthermore, as with all the books in this series, this volume is informed by the tenets of critical pedagogy, and is focused on re-envisioning fantasy literature through the lens of social justice and empowerment. Prepare to be challenged and inspired as you read these explorations of a much-loved genre.",

        "description": "Teaching fantasy writing increases student engagement, enables them to flex their creative muscles \u2013 and helps them learn important narrative writing skills. Opportunities for kids to lean into their innate creativity and imagination have been squeezed out of most school days, due to the pressures of standardized testing. And writing instruction has become more and more formulaic. In Teaching Fantasy Writing, Carl Anderson shows you how to include a study of fantasy writing in your writing curriculum that will engage student interest and creativity -- and make writing exciting for them again. Teaching Fantasy Writing is a game-changer. The fantasy genre gives children tools for expression that other genres don\u2019t, providing them with a powerful way to work through challenging issues and emotions. And it also offers students the opportunity to address subjects such as gaining confidence in oneself, bullying, fighting injustice \u2013 and more. Plus, fantasy writing helps kids learn the skills necessary to meet narrative writing standards. And they\u2019ll have fun doing it! If you\u2019re an elementary school teacher who wants to help your students develop their writing skills by studying a high-interest, high-impact genre, you\u2019ve come to the right place. In Teaching Fantasy Writing, Carl Anderson will: Discuss why fantasy writing develops students\u2019 creativity, increases their engagement in writing, and accelerates their growth as writers Walk you through fantasy units for students in grades K-1, 2-3, and 4-6, which include detailed lessons you can teach to help students write beautiful and powerful fantasy stories Suggest mentor texts that will show students how to craft their fantasy stories. Show you examples of students\u2019 fantasy writing, including the \"worldbuilding\" work they do before writing drafts Explain how you can modify the units and lessons to fit the needs of the students in your classroom By teaching fantasy writing, you can reignite the spark of creativity in your students and increase their joy in writing. Imagine the possibilities!",

        "description": "\"\"Fantasy Global Appeal\"\" explores the captivating global phenomenon of fantasy literature, a genre often seen as pure escapism. The book investigates how fantasy has profoundly impacted various cultures, reflecting societal values and anxieties across different landscapes. Interestingly, the study highlights how fan communities play a vital role in shaping and expanding the fantasy genre's reach, acting as a mirror that reflects cultural aspirations. This book meticulously traces fantasy's evolution, from its mythological and folklore roots to modern novels, films, and games. It examines how cultural exchange and adaptation have shaped reception in diverse regions, highlighting the genre's unique ability to resonate with fundamental human needs, offering frameworks for understanding identity and morality. The analysis progresses through key characteristics like world-building, explores case studies across Western and non-Western contexts, and addresses ethical considerations of cultural appropriation. Ultimately, \"\"Fantasy Global Appeal\"\" provides a comprehensive understanding of fantasy's worldwide impact by combining literary analysis with social science methodologies. It moves beyond a focus on Western fantasy, offering insights into globalization, cultural exchange, and the intricate relationship between fantasy and reality.",

The increased popularity of fantasy films has generated much greater scholarly interest in the study of fantasy films. It has also generated an artistic response by American Indie filmmakers who have developed alternative approaches to the portrayal of film fantasy. Reality and Fantasy in American Indie Films: A Cavellian Approach applies the methods and procedures of Cavellian philosophical film criticism to the study of four prominent American indie films released in 2014 in which fantasy can be said to play an important role: Birdman (Alejandro G. I\u00f1\u00e1rritu); Boyhood (Richard Linklater); The Grand Budapest Hotel (Wes Anderson); and Only Lovers Left Alive (Jim Jarmusch).",

        "description": "Fantasy Comics Influence explores how fantasy has revolutionized comic book narratives, examining its profound effects on world-building and character development. Fantasy isn't just a genre; it's a driving force behind innovation in comics. The book highlights how fantasy elements enable the exploration of complex themes and the challenging of societal norms within the comic medium. Historically, the integration of fantasy marks a turning point, offering unique lenses for narrative experimentation. The book approaches this topic by first grounding the reader in the theory of world-building and character development. It then transitions into detailed analyses of specific comic book series, illustrating how fantasy elements create depth. The book progresses by exploring world-building, then character development, and culminates with an analysis of narrative techniques used to seamlessly integrate fantasy into comic book storytelling. This approach not only identifies fantasy tropes but also analyzes their adaptation to create meaningful narratives. This book offers a unique perspective by focusing on the functional role of fantasy elements in enhancing the comic book experience, rather than merely describing their presence. It's valuable for comic book enthusiasts, media studies students, and those interested in creative writing, providing insights into effective storytelling and the cultural impact of fantasy comics.",

Recent estimates suggest that there as many as 33 million fantasy sport participants in the US alone, spending $3bn annually, with many millions more around the world. This is the first in-depth study of fantasy sport as a cultural and social phenomenon and a significant and growing component of the contemporary sports economy. This book presents an overview of the history of fantasy sport and its close connection to innovations in sports media. Drawing on extensive empirical research, it offers an analysis of the demographics of fantasy sport, the motivations of fantasy sport players and their significance as heavy consumers of sport media and as ultra-fans. It also draws cross-cultural comparisons between fantasy sport players in the US, UK, Europe and beyond. The Fantasy Sport Industry examines the key commercial and media stakeholders in the production and development of fantasy sport, and points to new directions for the fantasy sport industry within modern sport business. It is therefore, fascinating reading for any student, scholar or professional with an interest in sports media, sports business, fandom, the relationship between sport and society, or cultural studies.",

In them all England has led the world, with authors as different as Chaucer, Lewis Carroll, J. R. R. Tolkien, and Salman Rushdie.",

Rowling's Harry Potter has revealed not only the prominence of religious themes in fantasy fiction, but also readers' concerns over portrayals of religion in fantasy. Yet while analyses of these works fill many volumes, other fantasy series have received much less attention. This critical study explores the fantastic religions and religious themes in American and Canadian works by Stephen R. Donaldson (Chronicles of Thomas Covenant), Guy Gavriel Kay (Fionavar Tapestry), Celia S. Friedman (Coldfire Trilogy), and Brandon Sanderson (Mistborn). References to biblical tradition and Christian teachings reveal these writers' overall approach to Christianity and the relationship between Christianity and the fantasy genre.",

        "description": "This book illuminates the racialized nature of twenty-first century Western popular culture by exploring how discourses of race circulate in the Fantasy genre. It examines not only major texts in the genre, but also the impact of franchises, industry, editorial and authorial practices, and fan engagements on race and representation. Approaching Fantasy as a significant element of popular culture, it visits the struggles over race, racism, and white privilege that are enacted within creative works across media and the communities which revolve around them. While scholars of Science Fiction have explored the genre\u2019s racialized constructs of possible futures, this book is the first examination of Fantasy to take up the topic of race in depth. The book\u2019s interdisciplinary approach, drawing on Literary, Cultural, Fan, and Whiteness Studies, offers a cultural history of the anxieties which haunt Western popular culture in a century eager to declare itself post-race. The beginnings of the Fantasy genre\u2019s habits of whiteness in the twentieth century are examined, with an exploration of the continuing impact of older problematic works through franchising, adaptation, and imitation. Young also discusses the major twenty-first century sub-genres which both re-use and subvert Fantasy conventions. The final chapter explores debates and anti-racist praxis in authorial and fan communities. With its multi-pronged approach and innovative methodology, this book is an important and original contribution to studies of race, Fantasy, and twenty-first century popular culture.",

        "description": "Fantasy Publishing Facts explores the business and social science aspects of the fantasy genre, revealing the economic engines and social dynamics that drive this popular form of entertainment. The book delves into the publishing industry, examining sales data and market trends to understand the financial scale of fantasy literature. It also investigates reader demographics and the influence of social media on readership, providing a comprehensive view of the fantasy ecosystem. A key insight is the demonstration of how the fantasy genre functions as both a creative endeavor and a complex system. The book uses a data-driven approach, integrating economic analysis with social science insights to reveal the interplay between publishers and readers. For instance, author incomes and reader demographics are analyzed alongside social media trends to showcase the economic impact and social influences shaping the genre. The book progresses through four sections, starting with core concepts and methodologies, then analyzing the production side (sales, incomes, publishing houses), followed by an examination of readership (demographics, communities, social media), and finally, synthesizing these findings to offer practical implications for authors, publishers, and marketers. This multi-dimensional approach makes Fantasy Publishing Facts uniquely valuable for anyone seeking a deeper understanding of the fantasy publishing world.",

        "description": "The texts presented in Proportion Harmonies and Identities (PHI) - INTELLIGENCE, CREATIVITY AND FANTASY were compiled with the intent to establish a multidisciplinary platform for the presentation, interaction and dissemination of research. The aim is also to foster the awareness and discussion on the topics of Harmony and Proportion with a focus on different visions relevant to Architecture, Arts and Humanities, Design, Engineering, Social and Natural Sciences, and their importance and benefits for the sense of both individual and community identity. The idea of modernity has been a significant motor for development since the Western Early Modern Age. Its theoretical and practical foundations have become the working tools of scientists, philosophers, and artists, who seek strategies and policies to accelerate the development process in different contexts.",
