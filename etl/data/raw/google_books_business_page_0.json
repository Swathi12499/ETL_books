From flagship public research universities to small, private liberal arts colleges, there are few aspects of these institutions associated with more confusion, myths or lack of understanding than how they fund themselves and function in the business of higher education. Using simple, approachable explanations supported by clear illustrations, this book takes the reader on an engaging and enlightening tour of how the money flows. How does the university really pay for itself? Why do tuition and fees rise so fast? Why do universities lose money on research? Do most donations go to athletics? Grounded in hard data, original analyses, and the practical experience of a seasoned administrator, this book provides refreshingly clear answers and comprehensive insights for anyone on or off campus who is interested in the business of the university: how it earns its money, how it spends it, and how it all works.",

        "description": "Brian Tracy said, \"This book gives you a proven strategy to write and sell an excellent book on any business subject you know and care about.\" Todd Sattersten, co-author of \"The 100 Best Business Books of All Time,\" said, \"No one tells you how hard it is to write a business book. Luckily, Derek's 'Bible' makes it easier-much easier.\" Literary agents, publishers, Fortune 500 consultants-they've all had rave reviews for \"The Business Book Bible,\" the only full-length, in-depth book on how to put together a great thought leadership book. There are plenty of writing guides out there for memoirs, general business communication, crime thrillers, or romance novels. But until now, there's never been anywhere would-be business authors could turn to for help. That's unfortunate because business books present a completely different set of challenges. For example: - How do you connect with your readers so they trust you and your advice? - How do you artfully point to your products and services without coming off like a late-night infomercial? - How do you keep your reader engaged throughout the book, especially if your material is--shall we say--less than thrilling? No other writing guide can teach you what you need to know...and do you really want to learn the hard way? With writing your book, you want to get it right the first time. Written by a business ghostwriter, \"The Business Book Bible\" covers everything you need to know, from framing your authority to picking the perfect title, plus: - Figuring out how long your book should be - Winning the battle of writer's block - Nailing down your real reader (and what to do when they're different than your ideal client) - Giving away the secret sauce - The unforgivable sin in writing - Looking like a pro (and not a rank amateur) - Acting like a publisher (even if you have one) ....and much, much more. You'll learn how to follow the same 5-step process the author uses to write and ghostwrite multiple books a year. You'll see how to keep your book focused and how to cut the unnecessary material. You'll discover multiple methods of getting your ideas out of your head--and most of them don't even involve writing! John Spence, voted one of the top 100 business thought leaders in America, said, \"As the author of five business books, I sure wish I had read this one earlier in my career. It's would've saved me a lot of time, headache, stress, and money.\" Here's a startling example of just one of the great tips and tricks contained in the book: you don't start writing a book by actually writing the book. One of the biggest mistakes first-time authors make is sitting down at their computer, expecting to start with the first word of chapter one, and then write all the way through to \"The End.\" If only it were that easy! Amateurs try to get it perfect right from the start. The pros know that writing is a process. You start by getting all your ideas out of head and onto paper first. You'll have a jumbled mess that looks like a new jigsaw puzzle. You have to sift and sort through it to find the material worth using. Then and only then can you start piecing the puzzle together. It's a painstaking, time-consuming process-but one that's well worth it. Peter Economy, \"The Management Guy\" at Inc. said, \"Derek Lewis's 'The Business Book Bible' is by far the most comprehensive book I have ever seen on the nuts and bolts of writing a business book. If you're planning to write a business book, then you would do well to read this book first.\" Start writing your book by reading this one!\"",

        "description": "A Wall Street Journal Bestseller Named a Financial Times top title How to unleash \"human magic\" and achieve improbable results. Hubert Joly, former CEO of Best Buy and orchestrator of the retailer's spectacular turnaround, unveils his personal playbook for achieving extraordinary outcomes by putting people and purpose at the heart of business. Back in 2012, \"Everyone thought we were going to die,\" says Joly. Eight years later, Best Buy was transformed as Joly and his team rebuilt the company into one of the nation's favorite employers, vastly increased customer satisfaction, and dramatically grew Best Buy's stock price. Joly and his team also succeeded in making Best Buy a leader in sustainability and innovation. In The Heart of Business, Joly shares the philosophy behind the resurgence of Best Buy: pursue a noble purpose, put people at the center of the business, create an environment where every employee can blossom, and treat profit as an outcome, not the goal. This approach is easy to understand, but putting it into practice is not so easy. It requires radically rethinking how we view work, how we define companies, how we motivate, and how we lead. In this book Joly shares memorable stories, lessons, and practical advice, all drawn from his own personal transformation from a hard-charging McKinsey consultant to a leader who believes in human magic. The Heart of Business is a timely guide for leaders ready to abandon old paradigms and lead with purpose and humanity. It shows how we can reinvent capitalism so that it contributes to a sustainable future.",

        "description": "An inspiring and practical look inside the mind of Bill Novelli, one of the founders of social marketing, Good Business challenges all of us to change the world for the better and is a blueprint for tackling today's critical issues. From his humble beginnings selling soap in a sales training program to his rapid rise in the fast-paced New York advertising scene, Bill Novelli was well on his way to becoming a leader in the hypercompetitive business world. But it wasn't long before he became disillusioned with the drive for profits at any cost. He knew that his marketing skills made those companies successful, but what good did that success do for the world? That question sent him on a career path that involved taking the marketing and communication tactics long used by big businesses and applying them to social change. He found that this strategy was not only good for the world but also good for business. In Good Business, Novelli begins with his early career success in Mad Men\u2013era marketing, which left him feeling unfulfilled. He describes the process of changing career trajectory: how he helped reposition the Peace Corps; built Porter Novelli, a global PR agency for social impact; fought the Tobacco Wars; and became CEO of AARP, the largest nonprofit in America. Drawing practical lessons and principles from play-by-play stories of his experiences in large and small organizations, Novelli deploys his characteristic wit to stress the importance of building and maintaining connections with people\u2014and engaging them in the cause. Good Business, which is part behind-the-scenes look at crafting social and health policy, part inspirational guide, proves that you can do well (creating economic and financial success for yourself and your company or organization) by doing good (helping to solve the world's and society's major problems). Throughout the book, Novelli shows that you can make a positive social difference regardless of what business you are in or where you are in your career. Readers will come away with the message that anyone who wants to have a positive impact on the world can do it right now from where they are\u2014or can be inspired by Novelli's story to make the leap to somewhere they can.",

It's a tall order\u2014and a call that is only getting louder. In Can Business Save the Earth?, Michael Lenox and Aaron Chatterji explain just how the private sector can help. Many believe that markets will inevitably demand sustainable practices and force them to emerge. But Lenox and Chatterji see it differently. Based on more than a decade of research and work with companies, they argue that a bright green future is only possible with dramatic innovation across multiple sectors at the same time. To achieve this, a broader ecosystem of players\u2014including inventors, executives, customers, investors, activists, and governments\u2014all must play a role. The book outlines how and the extent to which each group can serve as a driver of green growth. Then, Lenox and Chatterji identify where economic incentives currently exist, or could exist with institutional change, and ultimately address the larger question of how far well-coordinated efforts can take us in addressing the current environmental crisis.",

        "description": "An against-the-grain polemic on American capitalism from New York Times bestselling author Tyler Cowen. We love to hate the 800-pound gorilla. Walmart and Amazon destroy communities and small businesses. Facebook turns us into addicts while putting our personal data at risk. From skeptical politicians like Bernie Sanders who, at a 2016 presidential campaign rally said, \u201cIf a bank is too big to fail, it is too big to exist,\u201d to millennials, only 42 percent of whom support capitalism, belief in big business is at an all-time low. But are big companies inherently evil? If business is so bad, why does it remain so integral to the basic functioning of America? Economist and bestselling author Tyler Cowen says our biggest problem is that we don\u2019t love business enough. In Big Business, Cowen puts forth an impassioned defense of corporations and their essential role in a balanced, productive, and progressive society. He dismantles common misconceptions and untangles conflicting intuitions. According to a 2016 Gallup survey, only 12 percent of Americans trust big business \u201cquite a lot,\u201d and only 6 percent trust it \u201ca great deal.\u201d Yet Americans as a group are remarkably willing to trust businesses, whether in the form of buying a new phone on the day of its release or simply showing up to work in the expectation they will be paid. Cowen illuminates the crucial role businesses play in spurring innovation, rewarding talent and hard work, and creating the bounty on which we\u2019ve all come to depend.",

Does founding your own start-up seem too risky? There is a radical third path open to you: You can buy a small business and run it as CEO. Purchasing a small company offers significant financial rewards\u2014as well as personal and professional fulfillment.

Sometimes business can seem so shady\u2014manipulating the \"bottom line,\" deceiving the consumer, or gaining promotions because of whom you know. But Wayne Grudem introduces a novel concept: business itself glorifies God when it is conducted in a way that imitates God's character and creation. He shows that all aspects of business, including ownership, profit, money, competition, and borrowing and lending, glorify God because they are reflective of God's nature. Though Grudem isn't na\u00efve about the easy ways these activities can be perverted and used as a means to sin, he knows that Christians can be about the business of business. This biblically based book is a thoughtful guide to imitating God during interactions with customers, coworkers, employees, and other businesses. See how your business\u2014and your life in business\u2014can be dedicated to God's glory.",

Each is an example of how an iconic company was defined by a particular moment of fame or notoriety; these notable and fascinating accounts are as relevant today to understanding the intricacies of corporate life as they were when the events happened. Stories about Wall Street are infused with drama and adventure and reveal the machinations and volatile nature of the world of finance. Longtime New Yorker contributor John Brooks\u2019s insightful reportage is so full of personality and critical detail that whether he is looking at the astounding market crash of 1962, the collapse of a well-known brokerage firm, or the bold attempt by American bankers to save the British pound, one gets the sense that history repeats itself. Five additional stories on equally fascinating subjects round out this wonderful collection that will both entertain and inform readers . . . Business Adventures is truly financial journalism at its liveliest and best.",

        "description": "The Antiracist Business Book is the first of its kind, as DEI business coach Trudi Lebr\u00f3n offers business owners real-life lessons on how to build, reshape, and re-envision their work to support and repair the wealth of all people. The Antiracist Business Book: An Equity Centered Approach to Work, Wealth, and Leadership is the business book for the modern world. Trudi Lebr\u00f3n has spent the last decade working as a DEI and impact coach for businesses, nonprofits, and entrepreneurs. And what she learned over that time was that making a lasting change wasn't about fixing the old system; it was about building a new one. In this seminal work, Trudi lays out a plan for all businesses, leaders, entrepreneurs, and coaches to remix business, so that equity and impact become synonymous with profit and power. Trudi provides lessons on understanding the long-term impacts of living in a hyper-capitalist, post-colonial world (aka White People Sh*t) to recognizing that the way we have viewed wealth (whether as an obsession or an obscenity). She will compel business owners and leaders to rethink how they do business. Trudi shares ways to create an antiracist business in a capitalist system, showing readers: How to make the shift from toxic capitalism to justice-based commerce \u2013 Trudi has spent years working with corporate leaders, online entrepreneurs, and mid-level managers on understanding how to build profitable businesses based on ethical transparency, justice-based leadership, and equitable business practices. She explains how justice can be found in a system that places profit above all else, re-imagining our economic systems not just in theory but in practice. How to move from the streets to the suites (\"-isms\" in business) \u2013 Trudi identifies the new form of leadership, which isn't from above but is built from the trust, creativity, and community usually found in the streets. As younger generations demand a new world order, the old one is dying and is being replaced with something remarkably more dynamic, equitable, and wealth-generating for all. How to make friends with money \u2013 This is for all you activists in the back row. Money is not the devil. In fact, without embracing and creating wealth generation, antiracism will always struggle at the corners of the conversation. In this work, Trudi will help readers heal their business journey, inviting them to redefine and re-envision their relationship to wealth. Unlike any other book on the market, The Antiracist Business Book takes an antiracist perspective. It applies it to how we are doing business\u2014at the top, in the middle, and at the bottom, offering tools for advancement in how we work, earn, and lead. The wisdom inside this timely and essential book advocates for a new order of business that creates transparency, opportunity, and disruption. Businesses can no longer be successful while operating as tools of the status quo.",
