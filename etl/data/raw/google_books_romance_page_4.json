        "description": "\"Barbara Freethy is one of my favorite authors! She creates amazing characters and stories, with a lot of love, friendship and mystery that make her books always very, very good.\" Cinthia - Goodreads Molly Trent is an adventurous, free spirit whose turbulent childhood has driven her to a new mission in life-to make people feel better. Unfortunately, a series of burglaries at her wellness shop puts her in the path of a cynical and suspicious detective, who thinks she does more harm than good. She's used to criticism, but she sees something in the tightly-controlled, grumpy police detective that she wants to unleash, if only she could get him to trust her. Trust doesn't come easily to Detective Adam Cole. He has been a loner for as long as he can remember. He's very good at protecting people. He's great at being a friend, but relationships that go beyond that-not so much. After a heartbreaking tragedy in his early twenties, he put up walls that are never coming down. Despite what Molly Trent might think, he does not need help or herbs to be happy. Unfortunately, what he needs is her. The chemistry between them almost makes him wonder if she hasn't cast some sort of spell over him. But he fights their attraction hard, because he doesn't do forever, and he can't imagine that an optimistic romantic like Molly would settle for anything less. But when they get tangled up in life and love, anything can happen... Irresistible and captivating romance awaits in TANGLED UP IN YOU, the next book in the Whisper Lake Series.

Althea Dailey has succeeded beyond her wildest dreams: she\u2019s about to make partner at her prestigious law firm in New York. So why doesn\u2019t she feel more excited about it? When she has to travel South for a case, she pays a long-overdue visit back home to Milford, Georgia. To her surprise, a white man she\u2019s never met has befriended her grandmother. Jack Darwent wasn\u2019t interested in the definition of success dictated by Southern high society. His passion for cooking led him to his current project: a documentary and cookbook about authentic Southern food. Althea\u2019s grandmother is famous for her cooking at Milford College, a historically Black institution. But Althea suspects Jack of trying to steal her grandmother\u2019s recipes. Despite Althea and Jack\u2019s first impressions of one another, they discover they have more in common than they\u2019d guessed\u2026and even as they learn about one another\u2019s pasts, they both see glimmers of a better future. This Southern small-town romance includes a free Hallmark original recipe for Grandma\u2019s Biscuits and Gravy.",

        "description": "This book examines illustrations created to accompany fictions written by several of the most popular authors published in Britain and America between 1885 and 1920. By studying the lavish illustrations that complemented not only initial serializations, but also subsequent publications of fictions by H. Rider Haggard, Rudyard Kipling, James De Mille, Robert Louis Stevenson, and H. G. Wells, the book demonstrates the significance of images to the fin de si\u00e8cle romance form. In order to make fantastic plots seem possible, graphic artists worked hand in hand with authors to not only fill gaps in audience understanding, but also expand and deepen the meaning of these marvels. The book will be of interest to scholars working in art history, visual culture, illustration studies, British and American history, and British and American literature.",

        "description": "Ponytale Talk is a collection of self-help tips and advice for working women who want to climb the career ladder, break the glass ceiling, or just want to perform their jobs to the best of their ability. Inspired by the author's own stories, anecdotes, and experiences while breaking the glass ceiling, Ponytale Talk tries to find a moral behind every situation, one that can help other women do things better than the author, Kimberli J. Lewis, did along her career-ladder climb. At the minimum, the author wants to give sound advice to help women lessen the bruises encountered while climbing the career ladder. The title Ponytale Talk emphasizes the need women have to discuss things and support each other. Inspired by the man-bashing, tea-toting sessions called \"ponytale talk,\" which the author's grandmother and great-aunts had in the sixties, Kimberli J. Lewis carried tradition forward in written form to reflect her own career journey and learning. Ponytale Talk fulfills our need to let it out and talk about it. Ponytale Talk is the working woman's career manual, mentor, and coach. Men are not excluded in this book but are also not painted as heroes in the eyes of author Lewis. Subtle criticisms surrounding men's behavior weave its way throughout many of Kimberli's inspirations and advice, although her focus is more on correct business and management behavior regardless of gender. Kimberli reflects on the start of her own career as an example of the battles that take place within large organizations when career starters try to position themselves for takeoff. As the scenarios move from the United States to Eastern Europe to Europe and then worldwide, Kimberli focuses on the challenges women face at all levels in the organization. Using her inspirations, the author draws lessons and conclusions from each situation and summarizes these in useful and practical tips and advice for working women. Ponytale Talk talks to the reader, and the reader may recognize many of Kimberli's experiences. The book allows the reader to gain new perspectives on the situations women face in both their private and working lives, and draw their own conclusions. Ponytale Talk reminds us that the road to career success or career satisfaction can be long and hard. It talks about the sacrifices that women have to make and the challenges they face along the way. The book is informative in best practices for management and gives women guidelines for being the best manager or employee possible. Ponytale Talk provides direction and advice for leaving a job, dealing with difficult people, asking for a salary increase, recognizing gender pay gaps, and much more. Talking openly about issues such as romance in the workplace or dealing with PMS in the workplace, Ponytale Talk leaves no stone unturned when it comes to women and work. Divided into four main parts, \"You and Your Career,\" \"You and Your Success,\" \"You and Your Situation,,\" and \"You and Your Future,\" Ponytale Talk communicates to the reader directly and allows them to identify with certain situations while providing them with tips and the advice. It simulates having a mentor and coach at hand. Ponytale Talk gives us the rare insight into the experiences, feelings, and learnings of an international CEO who is willing to share a lifetime of experience. A practical, enjoyable, and delightful transcultural and educational read for all women. Ponytale Talk gives great advice on life-work balance, good management practices, and how to succeed in the workplace.",

Showing up at the Countess\u2019 London home, she hoped to find a challenge, not a woman who takes her breath away. Catherine St Day looks forward to a quiet widowhood once her late husband\u2019s scientific legacy is fulfilled. She expected to hand off the translation and wash her hands of the project\u2014instead, she is intrigued by the young woman who turns up at her door, begging to be allowed to do the work, and she agrees to let Lucy stay. But as Catherine finds herself longing for Lucy, everything she believes about herself and her life is tested. While Lucy spends her days interpreting the complicated French text, she spends her nights falling in love with the alluring Catherine. But sabotage and old wounds threaten to sever the threads that bind them. Can Lucy and Catherine find the strength to stay together or are they doomed to be star-crossed lovers?",

        "description": "In the follow-up to It Happened One Summer, Tessa Bailey delivers another deliciously fun rom-com about a former player who accidentally falls for his best friend while trying to help her land a different man... King crab fisherman Fox Thornton has a reputation as a sexy, carefree flirt. Everyone knows he's a guaranteed good time--in bed and out--and that's exactly how he prefers it. Until he meets Hannah Bellinger. She's immune to his charm and looks, but she seems to enjoy his... personality? And wants to be friends? Bizarre. But he likes her too much to risk a fling, so platonic pals it is. Now, Hannah's in town for work, crashing in Fox's spare bedroom. She knows he's a notorious ladies' man, but they're definitely just friends. In fact, she's nursing a hopeless crush on a colleague and Fox is just the person to help with her lackluster love life. Armed with a few tips from Westport's resident Casanova, Hannah sets out to catch her coworker's eye... yet the more time she spends with Fox, the more she wants him instead. As the line between friendship and flirtation begins to blur, Hannah can't deny she loves everything about Fox, but she refuses to be another notch on his bedpost. Living with his best friend should have been easy. Except now she's walking around in a towel, sleeping right across the hall, and Fox is fantasizing about waking up next to her for the rest of his life and... and... man overboard! He's fallen for her, hook, line, and sinker. Helping her flirt with another guy is pure torture, but maybe if Fox can tackle his inner demons and show Hannah he's all in, she'll choose him instead?",

Not many have the courage for what needs to be done to maintain power . . .but I do. And I always get what I want. Including my son's fianc\u00e9e. She's mine now, and I'll use Francesca any way I see fit. She's the perfect match to my twisted desires, and I'll keep her close, ready and waiting at my disposal. Even if she fights me at every turn. FRANCESCA I was stolen away and held prisoner in Italy, a bride for a mafia king's only heir. Except I'm no innocent, and it's the king himself-the man called il Diavolo-who appeals to me in sinful ways I never dreamed. Fausto's wickedness draws me in, his power like a drug. And when the devil decides he wants me, I'm helpless to resist him-even if it means giving myself to him, body and soul. He may think he can control me, but this king is about to find out who's really the boss. MAFIA MISTRESS is a full-length mafia romance written by a USA Today Bestselling author. It's the first book in the Italian Kings duet, not a standalone.",

Shelly Hansen is horrified when her great-aunt's wedding dress arrives. Because according to family legend, she's destined to marry the next man she meets. So when she trips on an escalator and falls into Mark Brady's arms, she tells him--and herself--that she isn't interested in marriage. But then she starts seeing him everywhere. Is it coincidence...or destiny? After her own wedding, Shelly sends her best friend, Jill Morrison, the dress--which is delivered to Jill's hotel in Hawaii. But at least the man Jill sat beside on the plane--gorgeous grouch Jordan Wilcox--can't be the man in question, can he? She met him before she got the dress. But the gown always ends up in a wedding! \"Her novels are always engaging stories that accurately capture the foibles of real-life men and women with warmth and humor.\" --Milwaukee Journal Sentinel",

After a wild bet, Alexis Montgomery has had her world turned upside down. The cause: Daniel Grant, a ridiculously hot carpenter who's ten years younger than her and as casual as they come - the complete opposite of sophisticated city-girl Alexis. And yet their chemistry is undeniable. While her ultra-wealthy parents want her to carry on the family legacy of world-renowned surgeons, Alexis doesn't need glory or fame. She's fine with being a 'mere' ER doctor. And every minute she spends with Daniel and the tight-knit town where he lives, she's discovering just what's really important. Yet letting their relationship become anything more than a short-term fling would mean turning her back on her family and giving up the opportunity to help thousands of people. Bringing Daniel into her world is impossible, and yet she can't just give up the joy she's found with him either. With so many differences between them, how can Alexis possibly choose between her world and his? *** Why readers are falling in love with Abby Jimenez . . . 'Sweet and achingly romantic - a truly wonderful love story' Beth O'Leary, author of The Flatshare 'Full of fierce humour and fiercer heart' Casey McQuiston, New York Times bestselling author of Red, White & Royal Blue 'Let's get one thing straight, Abby Jimenez is hilarious' Goodreads reviewer 'I laughed, I teared up, and most importantly, I didn't want to put it down' Goodreads reviewer",

Dazzle (n): Brightness that blinds someone temporarily. Position Vacant: Two ancient old women residing at Providence Retirement Villa seek male assistant for casual exploitation and good-natured humiliation. Duties include boutique shopping, fast-food fetching, and sincerely rendered flattery. Good looks a bonus\u2014but we aren\u2019t picky. An advertisement has been placed (again!) by the wealthy and eccentric Parloni Sisters. The salary is generous and the employers are 90 years old, so how hard could the job be? Well, none have lasted longer than a week. Most boys leave in tears. Ruthie Midona will work in Providence\u2019s front office, and be at the Parloni\u2019s beck and call, forever. That\u2019s sort of her life plan. If Ruthie can run the place in her almost-retired bosses\u2019 absence, with no hijinks/hiccups, she has a shot at becoming the new manager. She might also be able to defend her safe little world from Prescott Development, the new buyer of the prime site. Maybe after all that, she can find a cute guy to date. All she needs to do is stay serious\u2014and that\u2019s what she does best. Until, one day, someone dazzling blows into town. Teddy Prescott devotes his life to sleeping, tattooing, and avoiding seriousness. When Teddy needs a place to crash, he makes a deal with his developer dad. Teddy can stay in one of Providence\u2019s on-site maintenance cottages\u2014right next door to an unimpressed Ruthie\u2014but only if he works there and starts to grow up. Ruthie knows how this sweetly selfish rich boy can earn his keep\u2014and be out of her hair in under a week. After all, there is a position vacant\u2026",
