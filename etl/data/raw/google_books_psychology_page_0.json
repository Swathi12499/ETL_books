Why do children see monsters in the closet at night? How have recent changes in technology affected adolescent development? Why does time seem to speed up as we age? Is it normal to argue during marriage? Does religion make people happier? How do we reduce social prejudice? How has morality changed over the course of history? What are the personality traits of people who succeed in their professions? Why do so many politicians get trapped in scandals? Does genetics play a role in voting behavior? Which therapies are best for which kinds of problems? How might the stress of police work affect decision-making in high stress situations?

        "description": "Doing well with money isn't necessarily about what you know. It's about how you behave. And behavior is hard to teach, even to really smart people. Money - investing, personal finance, and business decisions - is typically taught as a math-based field, where data and formulas tell us exactly what to do. But in the real world people don't make financial decisions on a spreadsheet. They make them at the dinner table, or in a meeting room, where personal history, your own unique view of the world, ego, pride, marketing, and odd incentives are scrambled together. In The Psychology of Money, award-winning author Morgan Housel shares 19 short stories exploring the strange ways people think about money and teaches you how to make better sense of one of life's most important topics. Praise for the book: 'It's one of the best and most original finance books in years.' - Jason Zweig, The Wall Street Journal 'The Psychology of Money is bursting with interesting ideas and practical takeaways. Quite simply, it is essential reading for anyone interested in being better with money. Everyone should own a copy.' - James Clear, Author, million-copy bestseller, Atomic Habits 'Few people write about finance with the graceful clarity of Morgan Housel. The Psychology of Money is an essential read for anyone who wants to make wiser decisions or live a richer life.' - Daniel H. Pink, #1 New York Times Bestselling Author of When, To Sell Is Human, and Drive 'Morgan Housel is that rare writer who can translate complex concepts into gripping, easy-to-digest narrative. The Psychology of Money is a fast-paced, engaging read that will leave you with both the knowledge to understand why we make bad financial decisions and the tools to make better ones.' - Annie Duke, Author, Thinking in Bets 'Housel's observations often hit the daily double: they say things that haven't been said before, and they make sense.' - Howard Marks, Director and Co-Chairman, Oaktree Capital & Author, The Most Important Thing and Mastering the Market Cycle 'Morgan Housel is one of the brightest new lights among financial writers. He is accessible to everyone wanting to learn more about the psychology of money. I highly recommend this book.' - James P. O'Shaughnessy, Author, What Works on Wall Street",

The volume uses an international perspective to illuminate important topics for all countries, including psychology's relation to liberal democracy, the psychologizing of social relations, and psychology's role in cultural imperialism.... An illuminating guide to the history of psychology. --Benjamin Harris, University of New HampshireThe history of psychology is at the forefront of the struggle to re-vision the discipline as a genuine set of global and diverse maps. Instead of a uniform topography where only certain features count, and the only places worth studying are those that are home to the original map-makers, this book offers a new cartography for those willing to invest in different landscapes of psychology. For those who wish to glimpse the future of psychology, there is no better place to begin than with this historical volume. --Henderikus J. Stam, University of Calgary and editor of the journal Theory & PsychologyWhile the U.S. was dominant in the development of psychology for much of the twentieth century, other countries have experienced significant growth in this area since the end of World War II. The percentage of those in the discipline who live and work in the United States has been growing smaller, and it is now impossible to completely understand the field if developments in psychology outside of the U.S. are ignored.This volume brings together luminaries in the field from around the world, including Ruben Ardila, Geoffrey Blowers, Kurt Danziger, Aydan Gulerce, John D. Hogan and Thomas P. Vaccaro, Johann Louw, Fathali M. Moghaddam and Naomi Lee, Anand Paranjpe, Irmingard Staeuble and Cecilia Taiana. Rather than presenting descriptive accounts of psychology in particular countries, each raises core issues concerning what an international perspective can contribute to the history of psychology and to our understanding of psychology as a whole.For too long, much of what we have taken to be the history of psychology has actually been the history of American psychology. This volume, ideal for student use and for those in the field, illuminates how what we have been missing may change our views of the nature of psychology and its history.",

Crapps deals with the major questions and figures that have dominated the psychological study of religion over the past century, dividing the discussion into four parts. Two chapters in part one suggest the problems and possibilities for the psychological study of religion in light of the nature of religion and the scientific method. Part two sketches the contributions to the study of religion of three intellectual currents in contemporary psychology: psychoanalysis, behaviorism, and humanistic psychology. part three explores the relationship between religion and human development, while part four directs attention to religious lifestyles and that weave differentiated parts of human experience into a cohesive whole. -- Publisher description.",

        "description": "A comprehensive treatment of the science and practice of organizational psychology Following a scientist-practitioner model, Organizational Psychology explores the practical implications of the current research in the field, expertly integrating multicultural and international issues. Beginning with a foundation of research methodology, author Steve Jex examines the behavior of individuals in organizational settings. Drawing on his experiences as a consultant and educator, he uses actual cases to illustrate workplace issues, offering balanced coverage of such key topics as occupational stress, motivation, and corporate culture. Also presented is unique information on research methods and the use of statistics in understanding organizations. With an emphasis on applying theory and research in practice, Jex explores the mechanisms that organizations use to influence employees' behavior, addressing the major motivation theories in organizational psychology. Readers will discover how psychological models can be used to improve employee morale, productivity, and quality of service. The focus then shifts from the individual to the group level-an important distinction given the increased reliance on teams in many organizations. Jex identifies the factors that have the greatest impact on group effectiveness and examines the dynamics underlying intergroup behavior. Finally, he moves to the organization (\"macro\") level, revealing a variety of ways in which organizations engage in planned change with the assistance of behavioral science knowledge.",

        "description": "This unique reference explores the processes and nuances of human habits through social psychology and behavioral lenses. It provides a robust definition and theoretical framework for habit as well as up-to-date information on habit measurement, addressing such questions as which mechanisms are involved in habitual action and whether people can report accurately on their own habits. Specialized chapters pay close attention to how habits can be modified, as well as widely varying manifestations of habitual thoughts and behaviors, including the mechanisms of drug addiction and recovery, the repetitive characteristics of autism, and the unwitting habits of health professionals that may impede patient care. And across these pages, contributors show the potential for using the processes of maladaptive habits to replace them with positive and health-promoting ones. Throughout this volume attention is also paid to the practice of conducting habit research. Among the topics covered: Habit mechanisms and behavioral complexity. Complexities and controversies of physical activity habit. Habit discontinuities as vehicles for behavior change. Habits in depression: understanding and intervention. A critical review of habit theory of drug dependence. Questions about the automaticity of habitual behaviors. The Psychology of Habit will interest psychologists across a wide spectrum of domains: habit researchers in broader areas of social and health psychology, professionals working in (sub)clinical areas, interested scholars in marketing, consumer research, communication, and education, and public policymakers dealing with questions of behavioral change in the areas of health, sustainability, and/or education.",

        "description": "Physical symptoms are fascinating phenomena to examine. We all experience them, use them as signals to guide our behavior, and usually assume that they accurately represent underlying physiological activity. At the same time, we implicitly know that bodily sensations are often vague, ambiguous, and subject to a variety of interpretations. It is not surprising, then, that there is often a disparity between what we think is going on in our bodies and what is objectively occurring. In short, phenomena such as physical symptoms are the stuff of psychology. My own research into physical symptoms started by accident several years ago. In a hastily devised experiment dealing with the effects of noise on behavior, I had to write a post-experimental questionnaire that would be long enough to allow the experimenter time to calibrate some equipment for a later portion of the study. I included some physical symptoms on the questionnaire as fillers. The experiment was a total failure, with the exception of the symptom reports. People's perceptions of symptoms were easily influenced by our manipulations, even though their actual physiological state had not changed. And so began the present inquiry. Despite the pervasiveness, importance, and sheer amount of time and money devoted to discussing and curing common physical symptoms and sensations, very little empirical work has been devoted to examining the psychological and perceptual factors related to sensory experience. Occa sional papers have tested a specific theory, such as cognitive dissonance, wherein physical symptoms served as an interesting dependent measure.",

Psychology is the study of human behavior. It is a serious and worthy endeavor that has given us scientific knowledge of the ways our minds make sense of the world. Yet, as cartoonist Grady Klein and psychologist Danny Oppenheimer point out, the study of human experience can also be often really funny. This is the field, after all, that brought us drooling dogs, snacking rats, and \u201cFreudian slips.\u201d With detailed observations on perception, stress, emotions, cognition, and more, Psychology: The Comic Book Introduction offers students and curious readers an entertaining guide to the ways our brains help us navigate incredibly complicated environments, yet often fool us in fascinating ways.",

        "description": "\"Learning Statistics with R\" covers the contents of an introductory statistics class, as typically taught to undergraduate psychology students, focusing on the use of the R statistical software and adopting a light, conversational style throughout. The book discusses how to get started in R, and gives an introduction to data manipulation and writing scripts. From a statistical perspective, the book discusses descriptive statistics and graphing first, followed by chapters on probability theory, sampling and estimation, and null hypothesis testing. After introducing the theory, the book covers the analysis of contingency tables, t-tests, ANOVAs and regression. Bayesian statistics are covered at the end of the book.

        "description": "Most new psychology instructors enter their first undergraduate classrooms with little or no formal preparation for their role as a teacher. The goal of this book is to review the body of teaching research that is available as well as some of the well-accepted lore, so as to make the first foray into teaching psychology a positive experience. Teaching Psychology outlines the major problems and issues confronting psychology teachers. It presents an overview of the \"nuts and bolts\" of teaching psychology including dealing with troubled and troubling students, choosing and using technology, developing evaluation instruments, and selecting methods for self-evaluation. Written by two award-winning psychology professors with over 50 years of combined teaching experience, the book offers a wide range of down-to-earth suggestions and immediately usable materials intended to help psychology teachers teach better and help students learn more. The chapters are organized to roughly parallel the sequence of tasks that new psychology teachers face, beginning with goal setting and ending with evaluation of one's teaching. Each chapter is chockfull of helpful tools including checklists, sample lecture notes, writing assignments, and grading criteria. To make it easier to customize this material, these tools are available on an accompanying CD along with a rating sheet for choosing a textbook, a student grade-record sheet, a sample statement on academic integrity and a pool of less-than-perfect test items to hone item-writing skills. This book offers guidelines for teaching such as: setting goals in line with 10 basic principles of effective teaching planning the basics including choosing a text, writing a syllabus, and creating a grading system setting a positive tone in the classroom providing tips on asking and answering questions, promoting critical thinking, and evaluating student performance. Intended for psychology graduate students who are learning to teach, faculty who train psychology instructors, and new psychology faculty at institutions ranging from high schools to universities, as well as experienced faculty wishing to hone their teaching skills.",

Poverty and Psychology: From Global Perspective to Local Practice seeks to remedy that by bringing together academics, community practitioners and clinicians who are actively involved in studying the ramifications of poverty in groups and individuals as well as outlining successful methods of participant intervention. With a focus on positive and critical psychology and the resilience of the human spirit, the book brings the psychology of poverty up-to-date with current thinking and scientific approaches, and will inspire and encourage those working in the field. Covering a wide range of settings, from the shanty towns of Brazil and Venezuela to the inner cities of England and Scotland, to indigenous communities of the Australian outback, noted contributors share their direct experiences and a positive message for working toward progressive solutions.",

These models distinguish between qualitatively different modes of information processing in making decisions and solving problems (e.g., associative versus rule-based, controlled versus uncontrolled, and affective versus cognitive modes). Leading contributors review the basic assumptions of these approaches and review the ways they have been applied and tested in such areas as attitudes, stereotyping, person perception, memory, and judgment. Also examined are the relationships between different sets of processing modes, the factors that determine their utilization, and how they work in combination to affect responses to social information.",

        "description": "It is well-established that while cognitive psychology provides a sound foundation for an understanding of our interactions with digital technology, this is no longer sufficient to make sense of how we use and experience the personal, relational and ubiquitous technologies that pervade everyday life. This book begins with a consideration of the nature of experience itself, and the user experience (UX) of digital technology in particular, offering a new, broader definition of the term. This is elaborated though a wide-ranging and rigorous review of what are argued to be the three core UX elements. These are involvement, including shared sense making, familiarity, appropriation and \u201cbeing-with\u201d technologies; affect, including emotions with and about technology, impressions, feelings and mood; and aesthetics, including embodied aesthetics and neuroaesthetics. Alongside this, new insights are introduced into how and why much of our current use of digital technology is simply idling, or killing time. A particular feature of the book is a thorough treatment of parallel, and sometimes competing, accounts from differing academic traditions. Overall, the discussion considers both foundational and more recent theoretical and applied perspectives from social psychology, evolutionary psychology, folk psychology, neuroaesthetics, neuropsychology, the philosophy of technology, design and the fine arts. This broad scope will be enlightening and stimulating for anyone concerned in understanding UX. A Psychology of User Experience stands as a companion text to the author\u2019s HCI Redux text which discusses the contemporary treatment of cognition in human-computer interaction.",
