        "description": "Although poverty is a global issue profoundly affecting millions of human beings, the psychology literature rarely focuses on this problem. Poverty and Psychology: From Global Perspective to Local Practice seeks to remedy that by bringing together academics, community practitioners and clinicians who are actively involved in studying the ramifications of poverty in groups and individuals as well as outlining successful methods of participant intervention. With a focus on positive and critical psychology and the resilience of the human spirit, the book brings the psychology of poverty up-to-date with current thinking and scientific approaches, and will inspire and encourage those working in the field. Covering a wide range of settings, from the shanty towns of Brazil and Venezuela to the inner cities of England and Scotland, to indigenous communities of the Australian outback, noted contributors share their direct experiences and a positive message for working toward progressive solutions.",

        "description": "What does morality have to do with psychology in a value-neutral, postmodern world? According to a provocative new book, everything. Taking exception with current ideas in the mainstream (including cultural, evolutionary, and neuropsychology) as straying from the discipline\u2019s ethical foundations, Psychology as a Moral Science argues that psychological phenomena are inherently moral, and that psychology, as prescriptive and interventive practice, reflects specific moral principles. The book cites normative moral standards, as far back as Aristotle, that give human thoughts, feelings, and actions meaning, and posits psychology as one of the critical methods of organizing normative values in society; at the same time it carefully notes the discipline\u2019s history of being sidetracked by overemphasis on theoretical constructs and physical causes\u2014what the author terms \u201cthe psychologizing of morality.\u201d This synthesis of ideas brings an essential unity to what can sometimes appear as a fragmented area of inquiry at odds with itself. The book\u2019s \u201cinterpretive-pragmatic approach\u201d: \u2022 Revisits core psychological concepts as supporting normative value systems. \u2022 Traces how psychology has shaped society\u2019s view of morality. \u2022 Confronts the \u201cnaturalistic fallacy\u201d in contemporary psychology. \u2022 Explains why moral science need not be separated from social science. \u2022 Addresses challenges and critiques to the author\u2019s work from both formalist and relativist theories of morality. With its bold call to reason, Psychology as a Moral Science contains enough controversial ideas to spark great interest among researchers and scholars in psychology and the philosophy of science.",

They provide glimpses of the giants who shaped modern cognitive and behavioral science, and shed new light on their contributions and personalities, often with a touch of humor or whimsy and with fresh personal insights. The animated style, carefully selected details, and lively perspective make the people, ideas, and controversies in the history of psychology come alive. The fields touched on in this and other volumes cover all of the subfields of psychology. As such, all volumes of Portraits of Pioneers in Psychology will be of interest to psychologists, as well as scholars in related fields. The resourceful teacher could use a selection of chapters as supplementary readings to enhance almost any course in the discipline. The major purpose of these books is to provide source materials for students and their teachers in undergraduate and graduate courses in the history of psychology. Each of the five volumes in this series contains different profiles thereby bringing more than 100 of the pioneers in psychology more vividly to life.",

In Authentic Happiness, he describes the 24 strengths and virtues unique to the human psyche. Each of us, it seems, has at least five of these attributes, and can build on them to identify and develop to our maximum potential. By incorporating these strengths - which include kindness, originality, humour, optimism, curiosity, enthusiasm and generosity -- into our everyday lives, he tells us, we can reach new levels of optimism, happiness and productivity. Authentic Happiness provides a variety of tests and unique assessment tools to enable readers to discover and deploy those strengths at work, in love and in raising children. By accessing the very best in ourselves, we can improve the world around us and achieve new and lasting levels of authentic contentment and joy.",

It also provides perspectives on the behavioral science of aging for researchers and professionals from other disciplines. The book is organized into four parts. Part 1 reviews key methodological and analytical issues in aging research. It examines some of the major historical influences that might provide explanatory mechanisms for a better understanding of cohort and period differences in psychological aging processes. Part 2 includes chapters that discuss the basics and nuances of executive function; the history of the morphometric research on normal brain aging; and the neural changes that occur in the brain with aging. Part 3 deals with the social and health aspects of aging. It covers the beliefs that individuals have about how much they can control various outcomes in their life; the impact of stress on health and aging; and the interrelationships between health disparities, social class, and aging. Part 4 discusses the emotional aspects of aging; family caregiving; and mental disorders and legal capacities in older adults. - Contains all the main areas of psychological gerontological research in one volume - Entire section on neuroscience and aging - Begins with a section on theory and methods - Edited by one of the father of gerontology (Schaie) and contributors represent top scholars in gerontology",

Cialdini combines evidence from experimental work with the techniques and strategies he gathered while working as a salesperson, fundraiser, advertiser, and other positions, inside organizations that commonly use compliance tactics to get us to say \"yes\". Widely used in graduate and undergraduate psychology and management classes, as well as sold to people operating successfully in the business world, the eagerly awaited revision of Influence reminds the reader of the power of persuasion. Cialdini organizes compliance techniques into six categories based on psychological principles that direct human behavior: reciprocation, consistency, social proof, liking, authority, and scarcity.

But today the field of personality science has moved well beyond the nature vs. nurture debate. In Who Are You, Really? Dr. Brian Little presents a distinctive view of how personality shapes our lives--and why this matters. Little makes the case for a third nature to the human condition--the pursuit of personal projects, idealistic dreams, and creative ventures that shape both people's lives and their personalities. Little uncovers what personality science has been discovering about the role of personal projects, revealing how this new concept can help people better understand themselves and shape their lives\"--Provided by publisher.",

        "description": "This provocative monograph defines the elusive concept of neoliberal psychology, focusing on its form, content, and cultural contexts and establishing it as a core feature of modern society. Its cross-cultural analysis examines the reality of neoliberal psychology in the globalized world, asserting that neoliberalism influences individuals\u2019 sense of self, identity, and\u2014regardless of country of origin\u2014concept of nationality. Macro cultural psychological theory opens out neoliberal psychology in its most visible aspects, such as work life, sexuality, consumer behavior, and the shared vision of the good life. At the same time, the author identifies profound social inequities and other negative aspects of neoliberal society and discusses how they may be corrected. Included in the coverage: Snapshots of neoliberal society and psychology. A psychological theory for comprehending neoliberal psychology. Neoliberalism as a cultural, political, economic, ideological system. The neoliberal class structure of phenomena. Psychological and cultural emancipation, and macro cultural psychological theory. Since neoliberalism is the dominant social system in today\u2019s world, and because it commands both strong support and strong criticism from diverse interest groups, Neoliberal Psychology will be of general interest to a wide readership. The book\u2019s psychological focus is a new window into neoliberalism that is more accessible than more technical accounts of its economics and politics, and it should appeal especially to social science students and professors.",

        "description": "In this instant New York Times bestseller, Angela Duckworth shows anyone striving to succeed that the secret to outstanding achievement is not talent, but a special blend of passion and persistence she calls \u201cgrit.\u201d \u201cInspiration for non-geniuses everywhere\u201d (People). The daughter of a scientist who frequently noted her lack of \u201cgenius,\u201d Angela Duckworth is now a celebrated researcher and professor. It was her early eye-opening stints in teaching, business consulting, and neuroscience that led to her hypothesis about what really drives success: not genius, but a unique combination of passion and long-term perseverance. In Grit, she takes us into the field to visit cadets struggling through their first days at West Point, teachers working in some of the toughest schools, and young finalists in the National Spelling Bee. She also mines fascinating insights from history and shows what can be gleaned from modern experiments in peak performance. Finally, she shares what she\u2019s learned from interviewing dozens of high achievers\u2014from JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon to New Yorker cartoon editor Bob Mankoff to Seattle Seahawks Coach Pete Carroll. \u201cDuckworth\u2019s ideas about the cultivation of tenacity have clearly changed some lives for the better\u201d (The New York Times Book Review). Among Grit\u2019s most valuable insights: any effort you make ultimately counts twice toward your goal; grit can be learned, regardless of IQ or circumstances; when it comes to child-rearing, neither a warm embrace nor high standards will work by themselves; how to trigger lifelong interest; the magic of the Hard Thing Rule; and so much more. Winningly personal, insightful, and even life-changing, Grit is a book about what goes through your head when you fall down, and how that\u2014not talent or luck\u2014makes all the difference. This is \u201ca fascinating tour of the psychological research on success\u201d (The Wall Street Journal).",

        "description": "This best seller breaks new ground by demonstrating how mainstream psychoanalytic theory has evolved into a psychoanalytic developmental object relations theory. The authors summarize the contributions of the major ego psychologists from Freud to the contemporary theorists, including the new findings of the child observationalists. By integrating these several contributions, the authors are able to show that classical psychoanalysis and ego psychology combine to form a unified theory that provides a more profound understanding of the borderline and narcissistic conditions as well as of the neuroses. From this comprehensive synthesis of theory the authors derive techniques for the treatment of the more troubled patient and expand the classical technique for the psychoanalysis of neurosis. Recognizing that there are preoedipal developmental problems even in neurotic patients and that there are oedipal issues in the borderline and narcissistic patients, the authors demonstrate the applicability of developmental object realtions theory across the diagnostic spectrum and include a new chapter on termination. Using numerous case illustrations from their own practice, the Blancks have constructed an extraordinarily comprehensive and readable text that updates psychoanalytic theory for the nineties.",

        "description": "View the Table of Contents. Read the Introduction.A welcome corrective to the texts that place North America at the center of the intellectual universe. The volume uses an international perspective to illuminate important topics for all countries, including psychology's relation to liberal democracy, the psychologizing of social relations, and psychology's role in cultural imperialism.... An illuminating guide to the history of psychology. --Benjamin Harris, University of New HampshireThe history of psychology is at the forefront of the struggle to re-vision the discipline as a genuine set of global and diverse maps. Instead of a uniform topography where only certain features count, and the only places worth studying are those that are home to the original map-makers, this book offers a new cartography for those willing to invest in different landscapes of psychology. For those who wish to glimpse the future of psychology, there is no better place to begin than with this historical volume. --Henderikus J. Stam, University of Calgary and editor of the journal Theory & PsychologyWhile the U.S. was dominant in the development of psychology for much of the twentieth century, other countries have experienced significant growth in this area since the end of World War II. The percentage of those in the discipline who live and work in the United States has been growing smaller, and it is now impossible to completely understand the field if developments in psychology outside of the U.S. are ignored.This volume brings together luminaries in the field from around the world, including Ruben Ardila, Geoffrey Blowers, Kurt Danziger, Aydan Gulerce, John D. Hogan and Thomas P. Vaccaro, Johann Louw, Fathali M. Moghaddam and Naomi Lee, Anand Paranjpe, Irmingard Staeuble and Cecilia Taiana. Rather than presenting descriptive accounts of psychology in particular countries, each raises core issues concerning what an international perspective can contribute to the history of psychology and to our understanding of psychology as a whole.For too long, much of what we have taken to be the history of psychology has actually been the history of American psychology. This volume, ideal for student use and for those in the field, illuminates how what we have been missing may change our views of the nature of psychology and its history.",

        "description": "In his last years, Otto Rank turned his lifetime of thought and learning toward two of the most difficult topics in human history: religion and the soul. The result was this now-classic work, available in this new, very accessible English translation. Unlike many other intellectuals of the twentieth century, Rank maintains a place for the soul rather than dismissing it as a fantasy. The soul and the beliefs about it, he argues, set forth the foundation for psychology, with its complex analyses of consciousness, self-consciousness, and personality. Rank's commentary is not limited to beliefs about individual souls but includes ideas about group souls, sometimes encompassing nations or generations. Rank suggests that it is in expression of group beliefs that the idea of the soul attains its greatest power.",

        "description": "`This is a competently edited, reader-friendly publication which fills a previously empty niche in the market. Every applied psychologist should have a copy well within arm's length' - British Journal of Educational Psychology Applied Psychology: Current Issues and New Directions is an exciting new textbook and a perfect resource for students taking either a focussed degree in applied psychology or a module as part of a wider psychology degree program. Given its breadth of coverage it should also be essential background reading on courses looking in depth at one of the many areas of professional psychological practice. The book is divided into two parts. In Part One, the book reviews the traditional branches of applied psychology (i.e. clinical, educational and occupational psychology); some relative newcomers (counselling psychology, forensic and health psychology); and some less obvious areas (careers guidance, counselling, academia) addressing such issues as training, future trends and developments within each field. Part Two offers discussion of more generic issues facing professional psychologists including the role of research and evidence-based practice in everyday work; trends in higher education; and continuing professional development. The book concludes with a `Round-Table' discussion involving leading psychologists commenting on trends and new directions in their respective fields. Key features of this book: - Consistently pedagogical throughout - chapter summaries, questions for reflection and discussion and annotated further reading in every chapter - Comprehensive coverage - all areas of applied psychology included - Related to the `real world' - by reviewing the issues and offering practical advice, this text should help prospective applied psychologists make informed decisions about their careers.",
