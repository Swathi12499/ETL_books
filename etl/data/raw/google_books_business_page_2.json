        "description": "When Profit from the Core was published in 2001, it became an international bestseller, helping hundreds of companies find their way back to profitable growth after the bursting of the Internet bubble. The 2007 global financial meltdown reaffirmed the perils of pursuing heady growth through untested strategies, as firms in industries from finance to retailing to automobiles strayed too far from their core businesses and suffered the consequences. In this updated edition of Profit from the Core, authors Chris Zook and James Allen show that a renewed focus on the core is more critical than ever as firms seek to rebuild their competitive advantage coming out of the downturn\u2014and that a strong core will be the foundation for successful expansion as the economy recovers. Based on more than ten years of Bain & Company research and analysis and fresh examples from firms responding to the current downturn, the book outlines what today\u2019s executives and managers need to do now to revitalize their core, identify the next wave of profitable growth, and build on it successfully. Zook and Allen explain how companies can: \u2022 Develop a strong, well-defined core and use it to establish a leadership position \u2022 Follow the golden rule of strategy: discourage competitors from investing in your core \u2022 Assess whether your core is operating at its full potential \u2022 Uncover hidden assets in your core that provide the seeds for new growth \u2022 Find a repeatable formula to apply core business strengths in adjacent markets Building on powerful and proven ideas to meet today\u2019s formidable business challenges, Profit from the Core is the back-to-basics strategy field guide no manager should be without.",

        "description": "Ever since the story of his transformation from homeless, single and struggling father to millionaire became known the world over, Chris Gardner --whose life story both inspired the movie The Pursuit of Happyness and became a #1 New York Times bestseller by the same name--has been inundated with two questions: \u201cHow Did You Do It\u201d and \u201cHow Can I Do it Too?\u201d Gardner\u2019s power-packed, transformational reply is the basis of this long-anticipated book. As a departure from standard self-help tomes that promise overnight riches and exclusive secrets for success, Gardner avoids any tilt toward magical thinking by staying with real issues and solutions impacting individuals in all walks of life. If you\u2019ve had the rug pulled out from under you, or have been dealing with the loss of a home, a job, a health or financial crisis, or simply can\u2019t find the motivation to pursue new challenges, Start Where You Are abounds with life lessons that offer hope and provide a road map for starting anew. This is also the book for anyone ready to launch a personal, professional undertaking, or break generational cycles that hem in their potential. Taking stock of his own credos, including \u201cThe Cavalry Ain\u2019t Coming,\u201d \u201cFind Your Button,\u201d and \u201cSeek the Furthest Star\u201d-- Gardner\u2019s 44 life lessons are earthy, soulful, and always accessible. With an array of stories from the author\u2019s own life, as well as from those he has known or admired, both famous and not, Start Where You Are has arrived just in time to embolden and encourage all of us, even in our era of great global change, reminding us of the infinite resources we already have in our collective pursuit of happyness, and spurring us on in only one direction - forward!",

Winning today isn\u2019t about beating the competition at the old game. It\u2019s about inventing a whole new game\u2014defining a new market category, developing it, and dominating it over time. You can\u2019t build a legendary company without building a legendary category. If you think that having the best product is all it takes to win, you\u2019re going to lose. In this farsighted, pioneering guide, the founders of Silicon Valley advisory firm Play Bigger rely on data analysis and interviews to understand the inner workings of \u201ccategory kings\u201d\u2014 companies such as Amazon, Salesforce, Uber, and IKEA\u2014that give us new ways of living, thinking or doing business, often solving problems we didn\u2019t know we had. In Play Bigger, the authors assemble their findings to introduce the new discipline of category design. By applying category design, companies can create new demand where none existed, conditioning customers\u2019 brains so they change their expectations and buying habits. While this discipline defines the tech industry, it applies to every kind of industry and even to personal careers. Crossing the Chasm revolutionized how we think about new products in an existing market. The Innovator\u2019s Dilemma taught us about disrupting an aging market. Now, Play Bigger is transforming business once again, showing us how to create the market itself.",

Those who have benefited from these techniques include business clients generating millions in additional profits, MBA students getting better jobs, and even parents dealing with their kids. Never Split the Difference provides a gripping, behind-the-scenes recounting of dramatic scenarios from the gang-infested streets of Haiti to a Brooklyn bank robbery gone horribly wrong, revealing the negotiation strategies that helped Voss and his colleagues succeed where it mattered most: saving lives. Whether buying a car, getting a better raise, buying a home, renegotiating rent, or deliberating with your partner, Voss shows you how to use these skills in the workplace and in every other realm of your life.",

        "description": "Imagine you are on a rollercoaster. The slight nervousness when you are in line waiting to board. The feeling of anticipation as you \"clank, clank, clank\" your way up to the top of the first peak, and then the rush of adrenaline as you accelerate through a feeling of freefall down the rails, followed by a jarring hard left turn followed by a jarring hard right turn. All this to stimulate your sense of danger and to create a true \"thrill ride.\" The enjoyment of a rollercoaster can only be achieved when you know and trust that you are safe throughout the entire experience. If there was ever any doubt that you were safe, you wouldn't even think about riding. Retirement for many Americans can be like a rollercoaster. We experience the ups and the downs, the jarring turns, and the panic-inducing plummets. However, we have no guarantees and no trust that we are going to be taken care of, so it creates fear and not enjoyment. Is that how we want our retirement to go? Does this sound like a \"fun ride\"? Fortunately, you have a choice how you want to experience retirement. For most of us, we don't want it to feel like a rollercoaster, and for good reason! For those who want to feel some of the ups and not the downs, there is a solution, and that solution is a Fixed Indexed Annuity. 7 Benefits of FIAs for Retirement is a holistic and easy to understand retirement readiness book. It is written to benefit both consumers and professionals. This start to finish retirement education is concise and effective and is a must read for every American.

        "description": "If you're in business you probably have three challenges:You want to grow - but have hit a plateauYou want to reach your goals fasterYou want to do this with less stress and hassle...Buying a business can solve all three of these problems:You can grow your business in leaps and bounds by acquiring similar businesses, competitors or your supply chain. You can literally double your annual sales in twelve weeksYou will get where you want to go faster - in months rather than yearsYou will do this with less stress as others will manage the business for youThis book will help you shift from thinking like an 'operator' to thinking like a 'dealmaker'. As a result you will have a larger, more profitable business which can be sold for more money, faster.JONATHAN JAYis a an experienced dealmaker, buying and selling businesses for over twenty years. Dealmaking transformed Jonathan from a business 'operator' working long hours for little reward, to a multimillionaire. He is still actively investing and coaches and mentors others to do the same.I have just completed The Dealmakers Academy Mastermind Programme with Jonathan Jay. This has been a fast-paced year of exponential group learning, ably led by Jonathan, a seasoned authority in the buying and selling of businesses in a variety of different sectors. His facilitation and delivery of the programme has been eloquent and effusive and he has generously shared his 'secret sauce' for nimbly and ethically negotiating and constructing business deals with very little money down! I highly recommend Jonathan and this programme to anyone who wants to take business entrepreneurship to the next level! I very much look forward to working with Jonathan in the future!

        "description": "Proven methodologies to enhance business value by exploiting the latest global technology trends and best business and IT practices There is no doubt that a tidal wave of change is hitting the area of business technology; new business models are forming around the cloud, new insights on how an enterprise runs is being aided by mining massive transactional and operational data sets. Decision-making is becoming almost prescient through new classes of data visualization, data analytics, and dashboards. Despite the promise of technologies to make a difference, or perhaps because of it, IT organizations face continued challenges in realizing partnerships and trust with their business partners. While many books take on elements of these emerging developments or address the stubborn barriers to \"real\" partnership, none make the practices involved fit together in a highly effective fashion - until now. Strategic IT Management in Turbulent Times reveals how this framework ensures that organizations make the right strategic decisions to succeed in times of turbulence and change.

        "description": "This first of a kind reference/handbook deals with nonlinear models and properties of material. In the study the behavior of materials' phenomena no unique laws exist. Therefore, researchers often turn to models to determine the properties of materials. This will be the first book to bring together such a comprehensive collection of these models. The Handbook deals with all solid materials, and is organized first by phenomena. Most of the materials models presented in an applications-oriented fashion, less descriptive and more practitioner-geared, making it useful in the daily working activities of professionals. The Handbook is divided into three volumes. Volume I, Deformation of Materials, introduces general methodologies in the art of modeling, in choosing materials, and in the \"so-called\" size effect. Chapters 2-5 deal respectively with elasticity and viscoelasticity, yield limit, plasticity, and visco-plasticity. Volume II, Failures in Materials, provides models on such concerns as continuous damage, cracking and fracture, and friction wear. Volume III, Multiphysics Behavior, deals with multiphysics coupled behaviors. Chapter's 10 and 11 are devoted to special classes of materials (composites, biomaterials, and geomaterials). The different sections within each chapter describe one model each with its domain of validity, its background, its formulation, the identification of material parameters for as many materials as possible, and advice on how to implement or use the model. The study of the behavior of materials, especially solids, is related to hundreds of areas in engineering design and control. Predicting how a material will perform under various conditions is essential to determining the optimal performance of machines and vehicles and the structural integrity of buildings, as well as safety issues. Such practical examples would be how various new materials, such as those used in new airplane hulls, react to heat or cold or sudden temperature changes, or how new building materials hold up under extreme earthquake conditions. The Handbook of Materials Behavior Models: Gathers together 117 models of behavior of materials written by the most eminent specialists in their field Presents each model's domain of validity, a short background, its formulation, a methodology to identify the materials parameters, advise on how to use it in practical applications as well as extensive references Covers all solid materials: metals, alloys, ceramics, polymers, composites, concrete, wood, rubber, geomaterials such as rocks, soils, sand, clay, biomaterials, etc Concerns all engineering phenomena: elasticity, viscoelasticity, yield limit, plasticity, viscoplasticity, damage, fracture, friction, and wear",

Expert author Raul Sidnei Wazlawick explains concepts such as object responsibility, visibility and the real need for delegation in detail. The object-oriented code generated by using these concepts in a systematic way is concise, organized and reusable. The patterns and solutions presented in this book are based in research and industrial applications. You will come away with clarity regarding processes and use cases and a clear understand of how to expand a use case. Wazlawick clearly explains clearly how to build meaningful sequence diagrams. Object-Oriented Analysis and Design for Information Systems illustrates how and why building a class model is not just placing classes into a diagram. You will learn the necessary organizational patterns so that your software architecture will be maintainable. - Learn how to build better class models, which are more maintainable and understandable. - Write use cases in a more efficient and standardized way, using more effective and less complex diagrams. - Build true object-oriented code with division of responsibility and delegation.",
